# Future for Everyone

> Future Player Assistance Mod: The player assistance utility mod not ideal for anarchy servers

Future for Everyone™ is a project aimed at providing Future Player Assistance Mod to everyone free of charge. We believe in free proprietary
software and Open Source Software (OSS) license compliance. At Future for Everyone™, we have dedicated time to reverse engineering Future
Player Assistance Mod and its obfuscation methods to accomplish our goals.

## Notice

- We are not the maintainers of Future, we only provide modified jars for the public that free the constraints in place by the original jars.
- This is also a PoC and very buggy. No support will be provided for this release due to the buggy nature of it.
- Asking for support in the CCC discord for this release will result in a permanent ban.
